    "text": "Summary: The Experience of Serious Risk-Taking Behaviors in Bipolar Disorders: Exploring the Potential for Co-Design Resources within Community Support Groups.\nGuillermo Perez Algorta, David Dinham & Emmanuel Tsekleves\nBipolar Disorder (BD) impacts millions globally, causing intense mood swings and risky behaviors. People with BD often engage in actions like substance misuse and financial recklessness, leading to prolonged mood issues and even life-threatening situations. However, existing interventions mainly focus on mood regulation, leaving a gap in directly addressing these risky behaviors.\nOur proposal offers a fresh perspective by introducing co-design to create resources for managing these behaviors. Inspired by Fuzzy Trace Theory (FTT), we shift the focus from detailed reasoning to a simpler, more qualitative approach. The key idea is to encourage individuals to grasp the essential meaning of daily situations involving risk and connect it with their personal values.\nIn practical terms, this means training individuals to use “gist” reasoning, to navigate situations involving risk. Our approach is guided by four themes drawn from real-life experiences of individuals with BD: “True Self and Risk,” “Empowerment, Sense of Control and Self-Compassion,” “Intolerance of Uncertainty in the Context of Risk,” and “Systemic-Relational Aspects Relevant to Risk.”\nCommunity Support Groups (CSG) could play a crucial role in implementing these activities. These groups, rooted in asset-based approaches, empower participants to thrive despite BD challenges. They offer inclusive opportunities for diverse learning, communication, and shared experiences.\nThe co-design approach is essential for developing interventions. By incorporating lived expertise from individuals with BD alongside clinical and research perspectives, we aim to create solutions that resonate with those they intend to benefit.\nOur “phygital” space, inspired by community allotments and gardens, will combine physical and online environments, fostering collaboration, inquiry, and knowledge exchange. This approach will allow us to address complex health issues related to BD effectively.\nIn essence, our proposal seeks to transform the narrative around risky behaviors in BD. By emphasizing simple understanding of risk, integrating personal values, and leveraging community support groups, we aim to empower individuals to actively manage their behaviors. The co-design methodology ensures interventions are co-created with the very individuals they aim to benefit, reflecting a commitment to holistic and impactful solutions for those navigating the complexities of BD.\n\nClick here to access White Paper full version."
